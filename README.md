A factory reset returns your iPhone to the condition it was in when it first left the manufacturerâ€”completely clear, with all your data gone. After you've backed up your data and turned off iCloud and Find My, you're ready to get started.

**Follow these steps to get your iPhone back to its original state:**

1. Tap Settings.

2. Scroll down and tap General.

3. Scroll to the bottom and tap Reset.

4. On the Reset screen, tap Erase All Content and Settings.

5. If prompted, enter the passcode set on your phone.

6. The screen displays a warning that all music, other media, data, and settings will be erased. Tap Erase to continue.

7. It takes a few minutes to delete everything from the iPhone. When the process is done, the iPhone restart and the iPhone has been reset to original settings.
